Utilities for running artificial-intelligence operations on top of RamFuzz, eg,
generation of training corpuses, parsing RamFuzz binary logs from Python, sample
neural-network architectures, etc.  Each source file here should have
self-describing comments.

Most utilities here depend on ../pymod being built and installed.
